========

- Just a mock ATS for serving data locally.
- The server expects data to be in the ***data*** directory.

###Installation
Just ensure nodejs is installed!

###Starting
- Run **node server.js** from this directory. Server would start on port *8188* by default.
- **node server.js &lt;port&gt;** for running on a specific port.
